        "A perceptron is a type of artificial neuron used in machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is a simple model of a biological neuron and serves as a fundamental building block for more complex neural networks. Here's a breakdown of how a perceptron works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Inputs**: A perceptron receives multiple input signals, each of which is associated with a weight. These inputs are typically denoted as \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n \\).\n",
        "2. **Weights**: Each input has a corresponding weight (\\( w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n \\)), which determines the importance of the input in the final decision. The weights are adjusted during the training process to improve the performance of the perceptron.\n",
        "3. **Summation**: The perceptron computes a weighted sum of its inputs, which is often written as \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i \\).\n",
        "4. **Activation Function**: This weighted sum is then passed through an activation function, which determines the output of the perceptron. In the simplest form of a perceptron, a step function is used, which outputs 1 if the weighted sum is above a certain threshold and 0 otherwise. 5. **Output**: Based on the result of the activation function, the perceptron produces an output, which can be used for binary classification tasks. Mathematically, the output \\( y \\) of a perceptron can be represented as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$y = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i + b > 0 \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $ b $ is a bias term that shifts the decision boundary. The perceptron learning algorithm involves adjusting the weights and bias based on the error between the predicted output and the actual output for a set of training examples. This adjustment process is typically done using a rule such as the delta rule, which updates the weights in proportion to the error and the input values. Perceptrons can be used to solve linearly separable problems, but they are limited in their capacity to solve more complex problems. To handle non-linear problems, multiple perceptrons can be combined into multi-layer networks, which are the basis for more advanced neural network architectures."
