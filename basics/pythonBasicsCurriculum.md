Christmas project.  If you're interested, you could create an Ubuntu virtual machine on your Windows computer over Christmas using https://www.virtualbox.org/ .  Try to learn some bash commands and how to install a Python virtual environment on your box.  If you have a Mac, it's not necessary as Mac's terminal is a bash shell, meaning like Ubuntu.  Newer Macs have a M1 CPU and virtualbox does not work there very well.  If you wanted to create a virtual machine on a Mac you would have to use parallels.  That one is not free.
