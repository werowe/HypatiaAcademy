        "The resulting matrix will have shape `([a.shape[0],b.shape[1])`, that is, the outside numbers.\n",

        "If `i` is the number or rows in `a` and `j` is the number of columns in `b` then for each `(i,j)` pair the number that you plug into that location `c[i,j]` is the result of multiplying vector `a[i]` (row) times vector `b[j]` (column).\n",
        "\n",
